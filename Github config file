Github config file

1. Everything that we configure, is stored in the config file
2. We can use git config to change the contents of the config file
3. To see the config file, use git config --edit --global
4. To change the editor in which our git files opens, set the environmental variable as our editor executable path and then call like this

git config core.editor "editor_env_variable -multiInst -nosession"
This command set the editor as our default editor
-multiInst - always instantiates the new instance
-nosession - always open the blank seesion


ln -s '/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl' /usr/local/bin/subl

The best & safest way to do this is to create a symbolic link from the Sublime executable file (subl) to a folder already in your $PATH (e.g. /usr/local/bin/). If you do this; you won't have to update this every time sublime updates.

There are three things that we can set 
Symbolic link
Alias
Environmental varible
